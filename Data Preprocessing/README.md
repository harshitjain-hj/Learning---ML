Data Preprocessing
===================================

*Process of transforming our data before feeding it to the algorithm.*
## Contains -
* **Handling Missing data -** \
    There might be cases when the dataset contains columns that don't have any value in it. 
* **Encoding categorical data -** \
Since mathematical formulas are applied on numerical values encoding it into it avoid future problems
* **Splitting datasets into a Training set and Testing set -**\
Testing how good the model is great when you test it by some different dataset that you haven't used to train your model with.
* **Feature Scaling -** \
Various machine learning algorithms are based on [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20the%20Euclidean%20distance,metric%20as%20the%20Pythagorean%20metric.) so it's better to scale the independent and (sometimes) dependent variable to be on the same scale.

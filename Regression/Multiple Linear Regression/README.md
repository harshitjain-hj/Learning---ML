Multiple Linear Regression
===================================

*A Multiple Linear Regression estimates the relationship between two or more independent variable(s).*

## <center><samp>y = m<sub>0</sub>x<sub>0</sub> + m<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + ... + m<sub>n</sub>x<sub>n</sub> + c</samp></center>

```Eg. Here profit generated by the company can be considered as example where profit generated is dependent on various factors like R&D, Administration, Marketing Spend, State etc.```

* <samp>y</samp> = dependent variable `(Profit made by the company)`
* <samp>[m<sub>0</sub>,m<sub>1</sub>,..]</samp> = slope constant `(Variation of Profit with respect to independent variable)`
* <samp>[x<sub>0</sub>,x<sub>1</sub>,..]</samp> = independent variable `(Experience)`
* <samp>c</samp> = constant

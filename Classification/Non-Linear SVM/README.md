Support Vector Machine (SVM) - Non-linear Kernel
===================================

*Support Vector Machine is a supervised machine learning model which uses classification algorithm for two group classification. The goal of SVM is to create the a decision boundary that can seperate the n-dimensional space into classes so that the new data point ca easily placed in the right category. The decision boundary is called hyperplane. SVM chooses the extreme points/vectors that help in creating hyperplane. These points are called support vectors and hence the model is called Support Vector Machine.*


 Non-linear SVM is used for non-linearly separated data, which means if a dataset cannot be classified by using a straight line, then such data is termed as non-linear data and classifier used is called as Non-linear SVM classifier.
